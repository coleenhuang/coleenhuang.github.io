It opened a new door for me, as it showed how programming as basically harnessing the power of the computer to make life easier. My desire to get better at programming grew when I started working at a lab. It was inefficient to use google sheets as a database for tracking thousands of mice. And also how painful and time consuming it was to manually count each data point on the photos of each sample. I felt that there must be a better way of doing this. "
